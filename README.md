## Why I never visit the trending page?

Because I never find things I am actually interested. That was easy to answer.

## The solution

Arranging the posts in the trending page in a more attractive way and also making the posts there to be actually important to the user. **And what is important to every user?** That should be answered by **each user**, but mostly the answer can be reduced to two main things: **PEOPLE** and **TOPICS**.

## Design proposal:

![front end- trending page 01.jpg](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1511560211/cttungi1fbqyyz1fh7qo.jpg)

## Details:
**Clicking on Trending**
The first trending posts should be related to the user's favorite topics and the people he follows. Then they start merging with those posts on the favorite topics + people he doesn't follow. And finally some posts according to recommended topics considering the whole Steem system.

Arranging the posts in that order would make sure the **trending page** gets visited. Because every user would actually see first the authors and topics they really care!

## Navigation bar
It should be a customizable navigation bar where the user can see all the trending topics, add up to 5 favorite topics and finally recommended topics:

## All
By clicking on **All** the user can see all the trending topics in the whole Steem system, also select the one they would like to explore. If the users clicks **All** but doesn't select any topic or clicks *All* in the *select box* he would be able to see the trending topics according to the whole **Steem system**.

That would be like the actual trending page.

## Favorite topics
The topics should be added as clickable buttons and with a smaller button to remove if necessary:

![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1511560580/nhhh7nsuahscgwlnlihy.png)

The user can add a topic by clicking the **+** button. And remove by clicking the **x** on each button. If they click in the button itself, the posts in the page will appear according to that *tag* and be arranged like explained before (first people he follows, etc).

Having 5 favorite topics could be taken as standard but it could be expanded to 10 or more topics.

## Recommended topics:

![image.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/hpiynhbhq/image/upload/v1511560600/mps03uxe9bpwoa8ickuv.png)

This topics will be recommended according to the whole *Steem system*. And be refreshed every 24 hours. The user can decide to delete a topic by clicking on the **x** in the upper right corner of the button; inmediatly another topic replaces the deleted one according to importance in the *Steem system*.

Also, being able to see more posts at a glance, makes it more attractive to everyone to visit and scroll for a while checking what's **trending**.

## Mobile version

The mobile version would work exactly the same, just with a few changes in design to make it work.

The user can see the post in an atractive way. Showing first the trending posts from people he follows and according to his favorite topics etc. as explained before.

If the user wants, he can tap on **All** to see what's trending in the whole *Steem system*.

And finally there's the option to tap on favorite topics and add or remove them. Same with recommended topics.
